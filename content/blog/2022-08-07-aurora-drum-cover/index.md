I've been wanting to record this for a while. This is my cover of "Aurora" by
Foo Fighters. Recorded as a tribute to the amazing Taylor Hawkins.
  
{{< youtube cq5FCdLD3Kc >}}

"Aurora" was apparently Taylor's favourite Foo Fighters song.

From [Classic Rock
World](https://classicrockworld.org/taylor-hawkins-reveals-aurora-is-his-favorite-foo-fighters-song/):

> “I’d say without a doubt, it would be ‘Aurora,” says Hawkins, adding, “I think
> it’s really, I love that side of Dave. I love it when Dave gets into his voice
> almost like a yacht rock and he doubles his voice very well. And that was the
> first drum track I did for the Foo Fighters that I was very, very proud of
> because I only played half the drums on the Nothing Left to Lose album because
> it was my first time in the studio and I was … I didn’t know how to record.
> Recording drums and playing live is very different and the errors are very
> polarized, once you are under the scrutiny of the microphones. You had to get
> it right.“
