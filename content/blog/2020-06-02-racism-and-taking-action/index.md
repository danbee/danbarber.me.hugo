The murder of George Floyd has sparked outrage across America and the rest of
the world, and rightly so. The death of so many members of the black community
at the hands of the US police is horrifying and utterly heartbreaking.

That this has happened against the backdrop of a global pandemic just makes
things worse.

I want to do more than just talk about my outrage on social media. I plan to
learn as much as I can about racism and how to combat it. My friend and
colleague [Sam](https://samkapila.com) posted a long list of books in an
Instagram story. I'm reproducing that list here and I'm going to be reading as
many of them as I can to educate myself do my bit to support the black
community.
