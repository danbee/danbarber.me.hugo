Quill is a rather nice looking Micropub client for the web. It posts
stuff to my blog using the Micropub protocol, which is a W3C standard.
We should be able to successfully translate various kinds of HTML into
Markdown:

* Let\'s make a list
* Let\'s make more list items
* And one more for luck

## This is a subheading

Here is some more text to see if my blog renders it properly.

> This planet hasâ€”or rather hadâ€”a problem, which was this: most of the
