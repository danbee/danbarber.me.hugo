Hi, my name is Dan Barber. Iâ€™m a web developer in New York. I design and build
standards compliant websites that are simple, usable and attractive using open
source software technologies.

In my spare time I play drums, guitar and piano (and occasionally the ukulele)
and make music using computers. I also like to dabble in electronics and video
games. I have built keyboards, a drone, an arcade cabinet and various apps, plus
I'm an avid collector of Raspberry Pi's. Sometimes I even use them for something
useful!
